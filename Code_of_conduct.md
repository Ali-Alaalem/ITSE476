# Fitness Log Code of Conduct

Our Fitness Log System project aims to create a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive community where everyone—regardless of background, experience, or fitness level—can contribute, learn, and grow. We are committed to fostering a positive environment of mutual respect, collaboration, and inclusivity.

## Expected Behavior

We ask all participants—contributors, maintainers, and users—to follow these principles:

1. **Respect:** Treat everyone with respect, kindness, and empathy. Embrace diverse perspectives and engage in interactions that are courteous and inclusive.

2. **Positivity:** Contribute to a positive, supportive atmosphere where people feel safe to share their fitness goals, ask questions, and provide constructive feedback.

3. **Open-Mindedness:** Be open to new ideas, fitness approaches, and personal goals. Encourage thoughtful discussions and respect others' paths to wellness.

4. **Constructive Feedback:** Offer feedback in a constructive and respectful way. Focus on improving ideas, techniques, or strategies, rather than criticizing individuals.

5. **Inclusivity:** Welcome diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to age, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, and fitness experience. Respect each person's unique journey and contributions.

6. **Harassment-Free Environment:** Harassment, discrimination, or harmful behavior of any kind—whether in discussions, feedback, or other interactions—is strictly prohibited. This includes personal attacks, offensive language, unwelcome advances, or exclusionary behavior.

7. **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Respect the privacy of others. Do not share personal information, fitness data, or medical details without explicit consent, and always handle sensitive information responsibly.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

1. **Harassment and Discrimination:** Any form of harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behavior based on personal characteristics (such as age, gender, race, fitness level, or disability) is not acceptable.

2. **Trolling and Aggression:** Disrupting discussions with inflammatory comments, personal attacks, or hostile language is not permitted.

3. **Spam and Self-Promotion:** Unsolicited advertising, self-promotion, or spamming of any kind (e.g., promoting products or services unrelated to fitness) is prohibited.

4. **Invasion of Privacy:** Sharing someone else's personal information, fitness logs, or health data without consent is strictly prohibited.

## Enforcement

Participants who violate this Code of Conduct may face the following actions:

1. **Warning:** A formal warning, along with an explanation of the unacceptable behavior.

2. **Temporary Restrictions:** A temporary suspension or restriction of participation in the project, including access to the Fitness Log System.

3. **Permanent Ban:** In cases of serious violations or repeated offenses, a permanent ban from the project and its activities may be enforced.

Enforcement decisions will be made by the project maintainers, and records of violations will be kept.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to [Fitness-Log@gmail.com]. All reports will be handled confidentially, and appropriate measures will be taken to address any concerns raised.

Let’s work together to create a positive, respectful, and supportive environment for everyone in our fitness community!
