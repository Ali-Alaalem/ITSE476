# Bicycle Rental System Code of Conduct

Our Bicycle Rental System project aims to build an inclusive, collaborative, and welcoming community where everyone—regardless of background or experience—can contribute, learn, and grow. We are committed to fostering an environment of mutual respect, open communication, and inclusivity.

## Expected Behavior

We ask all participants—contributors, maintainers, and users—to follow these principles:

1. **Respect:** Treat all individuals with respect, kindness, and empathy. Embrace diverse perspectives and engage in interactions that are courteous and inclusive.

2. **Positivity:** Contribute to a positive, supportive environment where people feel safe to share ideas, ask questions, and provide constructive feedback.

3. **Open-Mindedness:** Be open to new ideas and viewpoints. Encourage thoughtful discussions, and avoid jumping to conclusions or dismissing others' perspectives.

4. **Constructive Feedback:** Offer feedback in a constructive and respectful way, focusing on improving ideas or work rather than criticizing individuals.

5. **Inclusivity:** Welcome diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to age, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, and socioeconomic status. Respect each person's uniqueness and contributions.

6. **Harassment-Free Environment:** We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or harmful behavior of any kind, including personal attacks, offensive language, unwelcome advances, or exclusionary behavior.

7. **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Respect others' privacy. Do not share personal information without explicit consent, and always handle sensitive information responsibly.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

1. **Harassment and Discrimination:** Any form of harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behavior based on personal characteristics (such as age, gender, race, or disability) is unacceptable.

2. **Trolling and Aggression:** Disrupting discussions with inflammatory comments, personal attacks, or hostile language is not permitted.

3. **Spam and Self-Promotion:** Unsolicited advertising, self-promotion, or spamming of any kind is prohibited.

4. **Invasion of Privacy:** Sharing private or confidential information about others without their consent is not allowed.

## Enforcement

Participants who violate this Code of Conduct may face the following actions:

1. **Warning:** A formal warning, with an explanation of the unacceptable behavior.

2. **Temporary Restrictions:** A temporary suspension or restriction of participation in the project.

3. **Permanent Ban:** In cases of serious violations or repeated offenses, a permanent ban from the project may be enforced.

Enforcement decisions will be made by the project maintainers, and records of violations will be kept.

Let’s work together to keep our community positive, respectful, and safe for everyone involved!
